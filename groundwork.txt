got many particles, all rendered beyond GLPOINT

tips of flames move in complex trigonometric motion
- amplitude varies depending on the height of flame/its position
- a vertical 'acceleration' of sorts is added on, this is controllable
- relates to flame intensity of motion

Very random way of moving in real life, so trigonometric functions with
different amplitudes and frequencies reflect that
- sort of accurate, don't want to make the motion too complex

Performance is limited by CPU in some way
- Rendering really slows down when num of particles gets above million
- This might be because I've stored the particle image as a 3x3 array of
vertices to represent a triangle in 3d space
